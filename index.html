                    <h4>Plume - Learning Technology Agency</h4>
                    <p>
                        I was responsible for building an e-learning web application which was estimated to be accessed by 100,000+ users and had a six figure budget; and a platform for content management. This has been my greatest experience, where I had the support from a great team and was able to develop the frontend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I used React.js, React Router, React Query, and SCSS for the development. Using the API endpoints, I was able to use hooks and React Query to fetch and manipulate data. I had to use external libraries for localization, calendar and a text editor. The user authentication was done using JWT, where access and refresh tokens were stored in localStorage.

Using Express, I was able to create Schema model and endpoint; and connected the server to MongoDB. However, I faced challenge in deploying the API for production and hence switched to using Firebase instead.
